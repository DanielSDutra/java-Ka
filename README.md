# java-ka
In Egyptian mythology, and in a very simplified way, Ka is an essence that exists into Gods and Humans and from where different layers will overlap creating beings and differentiating individuals, exemplifying, the union of the Ka, Ba and Akh layers leads to the formation of the Human Being that inhabits the Earth; but several Ba with a Ka results in the formation of a God. From that analogy, Ka has the purpose of bringing together the most essential and necessary functions to the software, allowing the next layers to focus their evolution on specialized functions while still offering and using the essential functions already present in Ka.
